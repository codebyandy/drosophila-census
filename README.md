# drosophila-census
Developing ML model to perform drosophila census estimates.

This model counts drosphila melanogaster fruit flies in a region of interest from mobile phone images. It uses traditional computer vision techniques, such as k-means clustering for segmentation and the Viola-Jones algorithm for object detection.

This project is being developed for a study that tracks adaptation to seasonal insecticide pressure in Drosophila.

I'm new to machine learning and computer vision. I would appreciate any mentorship and advice.
